## Contribution guidelines

We welcome submissions of guides and tutorials that cover new types of integrations! Following these guidelines will help us maintain consistency,

- Include all the sections present in this [sample guide](https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/blob/master/sample/sample-guide/sample-guide.md)
- Create a folder with one markdown file using the same name
- Append a number if a guide needs to be split into multiple parts
- Use [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/tree/v0.20.4) for ensuring a consistent style in the documents. Rules are found in `.markdownlint.json` root folder.
- Use [Markdown+Math](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath) for Math notations.
